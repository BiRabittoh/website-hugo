This article is more of a memo for myself. Since I often re-install Linux systems, I spend a lot of time doing repetitive tasks and often forget some steps, which leads me to waste even more time figuring out what's wrong.

These instructions allow you to get a fully functional and modern-looking XFCE desktop on a fresh install of [Void Linux]() (even though they can be adapted to work in any distro).

## Initial system update
First thing I tried was to update the system, but the ISO was quite old. I had to update `xbps` before anything else:

```
sudo xbps-install -u xbps
sudo xbps-install -Su
```

## Avoid session saving
One thing I hate about XFCE is its fixation to save sessions. A lot of times I get my session saved and restored even with all settings turned off.

A quick and easy solution to disable session saving entirely is just to create an empty file in place of the `sessions` directory.
```
rm ~/.cache/sessions
touch ~/.cache/sessions
```

This way, even with everything turned on, XFCE fails create a folder with that name and everything works (or doesn't, in this case) like a charm.

## Change that shell
Your shell is the main tool you use to communicate with your system, so it makes sense to replace `bash` with something more modern and feature-rich.

```
sudo xbps-install -S zsh zsh-completions curl
chsh -s /bin/zsh
zsh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/install/master/install.zsh | zsh
```

## Get some good sound quality
I don't like `pulseaudio`. Let's replace it with `pipewire` and `wireplumber`.

```
su
xbps-install pipewire wireplumber
mkdir -p /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d
sed '/path.*=.*pipewire-media-session/s/{/#{/' /usr/share/pipewire/pipewire.conf > /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf
echo 'context.exec = [ { path = "/usr/bin/wireplumber" args = "" } ]' > /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/10-wireplumber.conf
ln -s /usr/share/applications/pipewire* /etc/xdg/autostart
xbps-remove pulseaudio alsa-plugins-pulseaudio
reboot
```

## Make Firefox more secure
I like Firefox as a browser, but it doesn't come with sane defaults as far as privacy's concerned.

First, visit [Firefox Profilemaker](https://ffprofile.com/) and create a customized `profile.zip`.

Then, extract your zip file to the correct destination:
```
sudo xbps-install zip unzip p7zip xarchiver thunar-archive-plugin
unzip -o ~/Downloads/profile.zip -d ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default-default/
```

Some useful extensions I always install are:
- [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager), a password manager;
- [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes), to serve common JS libraries locally;
- [I still don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies), to hide and auto-reject cookie warnings;
- [LibRedirect](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/libredirect), a redirector for [alternative front-ends](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends);
- [SponsorBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock), to skip YouTube sponsorships automagically;
- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin), the best ad-blocker.

## Customize your DE

Install the last required packages for desktop usability:
```
sudo xbps-install -S xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin xfce4-clipman-plugin xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin xfce4-screenshooter xclip micro neovim mpv yt-dlp
```

Remove orphaned and cached packages:
```
sudo xbps-remove -Oo
```

Now, open XFCE's Settings Manager and set the following options:
- Appearance &rarr; Style &rarr; Choose "Adwaita-dark"
- Desktop &rarr; Background &rarr; _&lt;Choose your favorite wallpaper&gt;_
