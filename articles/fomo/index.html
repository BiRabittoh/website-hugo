As long as you have a friend group and an account on any mainstream social network, yes you are.
It&rsquo;s the feeling that drives you to check out your friends&rsquo; Stories on Instagram, the dread you feel when somebody else reaches a life goal before you do, the fear that pushes people to buy limited-time merchandise before it runs out of stock.</p><h2 id=my-experience>My experience</h2><p>FOMO has been a constant for my entire life and just now I&rsquo;m trying to write this as a way to think critically about it and try to avoid being pushed by stupid instincts. I&rsquo;ve come to realize that Discord is the thing that slows down my productivity the most: as soon as I enter a voice chat with my friend, I stop being productive in any capacity and I&rsquo;m also uncapable of resuming for the whole day.</p><p>Even after I turn off my PC, I still think about what my friends are doing and what I&rsquo;m missing out on, be it a Gartic Phone round or any stupid discussion I might have had on there. The biggest problem is, it&rsquo;s entirely subconscious. I often find myself uncapable of concentrating and don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the cause of it; I&rsquo;ve been eliminating elements one by one to find out the cause of this and turns out that distancing myself totally from social media AND Discord actually solves it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not immediate either, it took a few days for me but your mileage may vary depending on a lot of factors. Of course, I plan on restoring my online presence after I have graduated but it&rsquo;s useful to know what exactly was causing me to waste all of my time for months.</p><h2 id=any-solutions>Any solutions?</h2><p>I think you should evaluate possible solutions yourself, as FOMO is strictly dependant on your personality and experiences. You could try eliminating or replacing parts of your habits regularly, like I did, to find out if something is more destructive than you might initially think.</p><p>As I was researching this, I found out about JOMO. It stands for &ldquo;Joy Of Missing Out&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s the exact opposite thing.
Embracing JOMO means you dedicate a few hours of the day to yourself and stop worrying about how your friends are doing at life and which continent gets invaded next.</p><p>Modern society does not wait for anybody, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong in taking a break and focusing on yourself. You can always catch up later.</p><ul><li><a href=gopher://republic.circumlunar.space:70/0/~katolaz/phlog/20190219_fomo.txt>Another interesting article about FOMO</a>, on Gopher;</li><li><a href=https://gopherproxy.vern.cc/gopher/republic.circumlunar.space:70/0/~katolaz/phlog/20190219_fomo.txt>Same article</a>, but proxied to be viewed on modern browsers.</li></ul></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/advice>advice</a></li><li><a href=/tags/minimalism>minimalism</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=border></a><a class=soc href=https://github.com/BiRabittoh rel=me title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>
