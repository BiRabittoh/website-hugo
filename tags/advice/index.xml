Let&amp;rsquo;s start with defining FOMO, to make sure we&amp;rsquo;re all on the same spectrum.
Fear of missing out (FOMO) is the feeling of apprehension that one is either not in the know or missing out on information, events, experiences, or life decisions that could make one&amp;rsquo;s life better.</description></item><item><title>Data Volatility</title><link>https://birabittoh.github.io/posts/data-volatility/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 10:31:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://birabittoh.github.io/posts/data-volatility/</guid><description>I tried to access my domain at smol.pub yesterday and I noticed the service went down.

As you probably know, I like using free software (free as in freedom, not free of charge). Most people see users with this mentality as a group of paranoid psychopaths who circlejerk about their custom systems. While that&amp;rsquo;s in part true, there&amp;rsquo;s much more to it.
I often get asked by Windows or MacOS users about why they should think about switching to a GNU/Linux OS (which I&amp;rsquo;ll be referring to as Linux); I&amp;rsquo;m just going to address everything here so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to repeat it to everyone who asks.</description></item></channel></rss>
